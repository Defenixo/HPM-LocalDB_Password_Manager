###  Overview

**Housaini Password Manager** is a desktop application that securely stores passwords in a local SQL database using encryption.

###  Features

- **Local SQL Database:** Your passwords are stored locally.
- **Encryption:** Each entry is encrypted with a combination of hardcoded and user-specific encryption mechanisms.  
- **Database Control:** Manage the database with a dedicated **DB Admin** account.  
- **Automatic Backups:** Specify a folder for the application to backup the database, and restore it anytime.
- **User Profiles:** Create multiple local accounts, each with a profile color and optional password protection.  
- **Aesthetic Interface:** I made sure to make this application as aesthetically pleasing as I can.

###  Personal Note

This is a passion project I created a few years ago simply to learn Java and JavaFX. This project tested my GUI skills, backend programming skills, and my patience. I think I came out of it a better programmer and ultimately I'm glad to have made this project. I will not be updating this project further.

I decided to upload it to Github in case anyone wants to explore the code, improve it, or fork it.

### âš  Security Notice

This is an **open-source passion project**. While it uses encryption and local storage, it should **not be treated as a fully secure alternative** to professional password managers. Since the source code is publicly available, anyone can analyze its methods and potentially reverse-engineer stored data.
If you plan to use this application, please keep that in mind.
